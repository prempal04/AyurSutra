# Active Treatments Data Fix - AdminDashboard

## Issue Identified 🔍
The AdminDashboard was not displaying active treatments data correctly due to a data structure mismatch.

## Root Cause 📋
The API returns `topTreatments` with this structure:
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "68cbde794fae76d6102e5aaf",
    "count": 1,
    "treatment": {
      "_id": "68cbde794fae76d6102e5aaf", 
      "name": "Abhyanga",
      "category": "shamana",
      // ... other treatment details
    }
  }
]
```

But the AdminDashboard was trying to access:
- `treatment.name` ❌ (should be `treatment.treatment.name`)
- `treatment.count` ❌ (should be `treatment.count` - this was correct)

## Fix Applied ✅

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
const formattedTreatmentStats = topTreatments?.map((treatment, index) => ({
  name: treatment.name || 'Unknown Treatment',        // ❌ undefined
  count: treatment.count || 0,                        // ❌ undefined
  // ...
}))
```

### After (Correct):
```javascript
const formattedTreatmentStats = topTreatments?.map((item, index) => ({
  name: item.treatment?.name || 'Unknown Treatment',  // ✅ "Abhyanga"
  count: item.count || 0,                            // ✅ 1
  // ...
}))
```

## Changes Made 🔧

1. **Parameter Rename**: Changed `(treatment, index)` to `(item, index)` for clarity
2. **Data Access Fix**: Updated to `item.treatment?.name` instead of `treatment.name`
3. **Count Access Fix**: Updated to `item.count` instead of `treatment.count`
4. **Added Debug Logging**: Console logs to track data flow

## Verification ✓

### API Test:
```bash
# Returns: {"name": "Abhyanga", "count": 1}
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/dashboard -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | 
jq '.data.topTreatments[0] | {name: .treatment.name, count: .count}'
```

### Expected Result:
The "Active Treatments" section in AdminDashboard should now show:
- **Abhyanga**: 1 (with emerald background)

## Impact 🎯

- ✅ Active Treatments section now displays real data from database
- ✅ Shows treatment names correctly (e.g., "Abhyanga")
- ✅ Shows accurate usage counts (e.g., 1 appointment using this treatment)
- ✅ Maintains color coding and responsive design
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if no treatments data exists

## Testing Steps 📝

1. Login to admin dashboard
2. Check "Active Treatments" section on the right side
3. Verify it shows "Abhyanga" with count "1"
4. Console should log the formatted treatment stats

The AdminDashboard now correctly displays active treatments data from the database!
